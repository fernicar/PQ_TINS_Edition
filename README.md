[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
[![Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-PySide6-cyan.svg)](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python)

A modern, offline, single-player implementation of the classic "zero-player" RPG, Progress Quest, built with Python and the PySide6 GUI framework. Watch your character automatically battle monsters, complete quests, level up, and acquire loot!

This version focuses on replicating the core single-player experience with a dark mode interface, inspired by the [TINS (There Is No Source)](https://github.com/ScuffedEpoch/TINS) methodology's focus on describing functionality.

## Key Features (Current Implementation)

*   **Character Creation:** Define your character's Name, Race, and Class. Roll (and re-roll) classic 3d6 stats.
*   **Automatic Gameplay Loop:** No user interaction required after character creation! The game plays itself.
    *   **Task Execution:** Watches progress bars fill as your character performs tasks like "Executing Slime", "Heading to market", or "Negotiating purchase".
    *   **Experience & Leveling:** Gain XP automatically over time. Level up to increase HP/MP, gain stat points, and potentially learn new spells.
    *   **Quest System:** Automatically accepts, progresses through, and completes randomly generated quests (Exterminate, Seek, Deliver, Fetch, Placate), earning rewards.
    *   **Plot Progression:** Advance through Acts ("Prologue", "Act I", etc.) by filling the plot progress bar over longer periods.
    *   **Simulated Combat:** Encounters appropriately (or inappropriately) leveled monsters with generated modifiers.
    *   **Economy & Inventory:** Collect gold and items (both boring and special). Automatically travels to market to sell loot when encumbered. Automatically attempts to buy better equipment when affordable.
    *   **Equipment:** Automatically generated equipment is equipped based on character level progression and quest/act rewards.
*   **Persistent State:** Game saves automatically on exit and loads the most recent save on startup.
    *   Uses the web version savegame format (`.pqw` files).
    *   Window position and size remembered using `QSettings`.
*   **Customizable UI:** Built with PySide6, featuring:
    *   Multiple style options (Fusion, Windows, Windows Vista, Windows 11)
    *   Color scheme options (Auto/System, Light, Dark)
    *   Comfortable viewing during long progress sessions
*   **Offline Focus:** This version does *not* include the original's multiplayer features (server communication, bragging, realm selection).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher recommended.
*   `pip` (Python package installer).
*   PySide6 (Qt for Python).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fernicar/PQ_TINS_Edition
    cd PQ_TINS_Edition
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install PySide6
    ```

3.  **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **GUI Framework:** PySide6 (The official Qt for Python project)
*   **Settings:** `QSettings` (for window geometry and last file path)
*   **Styling:** QSS (Qt Style Sheets) for custom styling and theming

## File Structure

*   `main.py`: The main application file, setting up the PySide6 UI (`MainWindow`), managing the game timer, handling saving/loading, and connecting the UI to the game logic.
    * Contains the `MainWindow` class for the main game interface
    * Implements `NewCharacterDialog` for character creation
    * Includes `AboutDialog` for license and attribution information
    * Manages UI updates, theme selection, and color schemes
*   `game.py`: Core game logic including character creation, state management, save/load functionality, and game progression mechanics.
    * Defines game constants (races, classes, monsters, items, etc.)
    * Implements PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) for consistent random generation
    * Handles character progression (leveling, quests, plot advancement)
    * Manages inventory, equipment, and spell systems
    * Provides save/load functionality with base64 encoding

## Saving and Loading

*   The game automatically attempts to load the most recent `.pqw` file found on startup.
*   If no save is found, it prompts for new character creation.
*   The game state is saved automatically:
    * Every minute during gameplay
    * When closing the application
    * When creating a new character
    * Manually through `File -> Save Game`
*   Save files use the `.pqw` format with the character's name (e.g., `CharacterName.pqw`)
*   Window size and position are saved using `QSettings`

## User Interface

*   **Main Window:** Three-column layout with character information, inventory, and quest/plot panels
*   **Menu System:**
    *   **File Menu:** New Character, Load/Save Game, Exit
    *   **View Menu:** Color Scheme (Auto/Light/Dark), Style (Fusion, Windows, etc.)
    *   **Help Menu:** Visit Repository, About dialog
*   **Progress Bars:** Visual indicators for Experience, Encumbrance, Plot, Quest, and current Task

## Technical Details

*   **Python:** Port of the original web version (HTML/JavaScript) logic to Python
*   **UI:** Built with PySide6, using QSS for styling and QSettings for window geometry
*   **Game Loop:** Uses QTimer with 50ms interval (matches original clock.js)
*   **Auto-Save:** Occurs every 60 seconds during gameplay
*   **Theme System:**
    * Uses QT Styles like Fusion, Windows, Windows Vista, and Windows 11
    * Default Fusion style for consistent cross-platform appearance
    * Color scheme options: Auto (system default), Light, and Dark
    * Style and color scheme can be changed via the View menu
*   **Save Format:** Uses JSON format with base64 encoding
*   **State Management:**
    * Maintains PRNG state for consistent random generation
    * Tracks character stats, inventory, spells, quests, and plot progression
    * Automatically calculates "best" stats/spells/equipment
*   **Game Mechanics:**
    * 21 playable races (Half Orc, Talking Pony, Enchanted Motorcycle, etc.)
    * 18 character classes (Ur-Paladin, Robot Monk, Slow Poisoner, etc.)
    * 47+ spells to learn and level up
    * 11 equipment slots with procedurally generated items
    * 180+ monster types with modifiers for difficulty scaling
